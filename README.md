# Robinhood Dividends with Django


## Objective

This project aims to build a Django web application that uses the Robhinhood API to access a user's portfolio and summarize the portfolio's holdings and dividend history. The application is hosted publicly on Google Cloud Platform using a Standard App Engine environment. The project serves as addtional practice with some of the Django functionality we learned in class, as well as diving deeper into more advanced webpages.
